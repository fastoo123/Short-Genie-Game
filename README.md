# Short-Genie-Game
A short visual novel-type game that I made with some classmates for my Java group project to show my knowledge of Java Swing GUIs.

INSTRUCTIONS
Make sure that you have JRE (Java Runtime Environment) installed.
Choose a wish.
After choosing a wish, Open up the messages app, the green app icon with a white speech bubble.
Click the contact photo with an exclamation point on it.
Enjoy.

There is only one ending per wish due to lack of time but if I do decide to redo this, then I will do it in FX and upload it as well to see the difference.
